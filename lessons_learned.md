# Lessons Learned — PM2 Monitor Development

This document captures key technical insights, architectural decisions, and lessons learned during the development of the PM2 Monitor macOS application.

## Project Overview

The PM2 Monitor is a native macOS status bar application built with Swift and AppKit that provides a GUI interface for managing PM2-controlled Node.js processes. Development involved overcoming significant technical challenges related to macOS app sandboxing, process execution permissions, and GUI-launched application environment handling.

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Native macOS Development (Swift + AppKit)

**Decision**: Use Swift and AppKit for native macOS development instead of cross-platform solutions like Electron.

**Rationale**:
- Better performance and resource efficiency
- Native macOS look and feel
- Direct access to macOS system APIs
- Smaller app footprint

**Outcome**: ✅ **Successful** - Application performs well with minimal resource usage and integrates seamlessly with macOS.

### 2. Direct PM2 CLI Integration

**Decision**: Execute PM2 commands directly via CLI rather than using PM2's programmatic API.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation without Node.js dependencies
- Direct access to all PM2 features
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting
- No version compatibility issues with PM2 API changes

**Challenges Encountered**:
- GUI applications don't inherit terminal PATH environment
- macOS sandbox restrictions prevented external process execution
- PM2 binary location needed explicit handling

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Explicit PATH management in `PM2Manager.swift`
- Removed app sandbox restrictions via entitlements
- Hardcoded PM2 binary path as fallback (`/opt/homebrew/bin/pm2`)

**Outcome**: ✅ **Successful** - Reliable PM2 command execution with proper error handling.

### 3. No App Sandboxing

**Decision**: Remove macOS app sandbox restrictions to allow PM2 CLI execution.

**Initial Approach**: Attempted to work within sandbox restrictions using specific entitlements.

**Problem**: Sandbox prevented `Process()` execution of external binaries, causing PM2 commands to fail with exit code -1.

**Solution**: Completely removed `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` from entitlements file.

**Security Implications**:
- App has full system access (necessary for PM2 management)
- Users should understand app has elevated permissions
- Future versions could implement more granular permissions

**Outcome**: ✅ **Successful** - PM2 commands execute properly without sandbox blocking.

## Major Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: StatusBarController Corruption

**Problem**: Initial app startup failed due to corrupted Swift file causing compilation errors.

**Root Cause**: File corruption during editing process disrupted Swift syntax.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `StatusBarController.swift` from scratch
- Implemented proper Swift classes and methods
- Added comprehensive error handling

**Lesson Learned**: Always maintain clean code structure and use version control for critical changes.

### Challenge 2: GUI Application PATH Environment

**Problem**: GUI-launched applications don't inherit terminal PATH, preventing PM2 binary discovery.

**Error Manifested As**:
```
Could not launch pm2: The file 'pm2' doesn't exist.
```

**Root Cause**: macOS GUI applications have minimal environment variables, missing `/opt/homebrew/bin` from PATH.

**Solution**:
```swift
// Explicit PATH management
var environment = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment
var path = environment["PATH"] ?? ""
if !path.contains("/opt/homebrew/bin") {
    path = "/opt/homebrew/bin:" + path
}
```

**Lesson Learned**: Always explicitly manage environment variables for GUI applications that need to execute command-line tools.

### Challenge 3: App Sandbox Blocking External Processes

**Problem**: PM2 commands failed with mysterious exit code -1 even with correct PATH.

**Investigation Process**:
1. **Initial debugging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout `PM2Manager`
2. **Environment verification**: Confirmed PATH and PM2 binary existence
3. **Process execution testing**: Isolated `Process()` execution
4. **Entitlements analysis**: Discovered sandbox was blocking external process execution

**Solution**: Removed app sandbox entirely by deleting `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` from entitlements.

**Debug Logs That Revealed the Issue**:
```
PM2Manager: Running command: /opt/homebrew/bin/pm2 jlist
PM2Manager: PATH: /opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
PM2Manager: PM2 binary exists: true
PM2Manager: Process terminated with exit code: -1
PM2Manager: Error output: (empty)
```

**Lesson Learned**: macOS app sandbox restrictions can silently block external process execution. Debug with comprehensive logging and test without sandbox if process execution fails mysteriously.

### Challenge 4: NSStatusItem Keyboard Input Limitations

**Problem**: Modal windows/dialogs in status bar applications cannot receive keyboard input by default.

**Root Cause**: Status bar apps use `.accessory` activation policy which prevents them from becoming the "key application" required for keyboard events.

**Symptoms**: Text fields appear functional (can paste via right-click) but typing doesn't work.

**Solution**:
```swift
// Before showing modal window:
NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)

// Show window with proper key window setup:
window.makeKey()
window.makeFirstResponder(textField)
textField.becomeFirstResponder()

// After closing modal window:
NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)
```

**Lesson Learned**: Status bar applications have fundamental limitations requiring specific activation policy workarounds for keyboard input.

### Challenge 5: JSON Parsing and UI Updates

**Problem**: PM2 JSON output needed parsing and thread-safe UI updates.

**Solution**:
- Implemented robust JSON parsing with error handling
- Used `DispatchQueue.main.async` for UI updates from background threads
- Added comprehensive error handling for malformed JSON

**Code Pattern**:
```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
    let processes = self.pm2Manager.getPM2ProcessList()
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.updateMenu(with: processes)
    }
}
```

**Lesson Learned**: Always handle background operations and main thread UI updates properly in macOS applications.

## Development Process Insights

### 1. Debugging Strategy
